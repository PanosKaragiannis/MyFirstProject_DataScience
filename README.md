# Project Future - Data Science

My goal throughout this exercise is to
familiarize myself with the domain and use this knowledge to produce value for the bank,
through the analysis of the data.

I used Python's libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Keras and Scikit-learn for this implementation. 

1)Data Analysis / Data preprocessing
2)Prediction
3)Classification
4)User Modeling
5)Unengaged and Churned users
